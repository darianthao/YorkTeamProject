## Welcome to Shady Shack!

As members of York Solution's [Barriers To Entry Program](https://yorksolutions.net/b2e-career-seekers/ "Barriers To Entry"), 
we were deemed to create 
an ecommerce application, focusing on JavaScript, React, Java, and Spring Boot. 
Within hours, our focus aligned, and Shady Shack was born. 

Between December 22, 2021 and January 13, 2022, 
we started with a `create-react-app bbfs21-team-2`, which has grown into what you see here.
We are proud to show off the progress of our combined organizational and coding skills, 
whether they have been developed as recently as in the last 8 weeks, over time within 
a formal educational or professional setting, or by using 
one of the plentiful resources on the world wide web.

We hope you enjoy the results of our effort and teamwork!

Planning also included creating teams that focused on frontend, backend, or edge case groups. Multiple
meetings, including 9am weekday stand-ups, were crucial to the beginning stages. Overall, members were able and
encouraged to move between front and backend code development.

[comment]: <> (use an instance of the product controller and use its methods)

[comment]: <> (so you instantiate like you do in java but the problem is)

[comment]: <> (1. they could interact poorly)

[comment]: <> (2. there is one product controller and autowired keeps it all organized.)

[comment]: <> (autowired reference vs instance)

[comment]: <> (loosely coupled)

## UI

We decided to stick to a simple, dynamic color scheme, and implement a majority of our styling
with [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and basic 
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). We also checked out other ecommerce sites and took 
notes about what we liked, what we thought we could implement, and what would also reach MVP. A few examples 
we referred to are 
[Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/), [Bombas](https://www.bombas.com), and [Razer](https://www.razer.com/).


## Built With

- JavaScript
